## Leonardo Miguel Virtusio Lanto - My Weekly Portfolio
# Week 1
- This week, I was introduced to a new course called **DISMATH** or *Discrete Mathematics*
- I introduced myself to class as a person who loves to chill. In order to get through **DISMATH**, I know I'd have to change that. I'd work as hard as ever.
  * **Argument** - Statements that end with a conclusion.
  * **Valid** - Final statement must follow the truth of preceding statement.
  * **Fallacy** - Invalid or Incorrect reasoning.
  * **Tautology** - Statement is always true.
- I was introduced to logical connectives, propositional statements, mathematical proofs, logical connectives and the like.
- I also learned about truth tables. I need to remember the process carefully because truth tables would really be essential for proving.
- I was also introdcued to propositional logic.

# Week 2
- I was introduced to logical equivalances. My thoughts about it was that it was like algebra, only that it uses words.
- I also learned about quantifiers. There are two types of quantifiers:
  * **Existential Quantifier** - "There Exists" meaning that there is at least one true value within the statement.
  * **Universal Quantifier** - "For all" which states that statement is true for all values.
- I've also been introduced to the topic of the terminologies of rules of inference.

# Week 3
- We were tasked to prove that *Superman* does not exist. Although I wasn't able to get it right away, I've found logical explanation through class hours.
- We learnt about the different rules of inferences. Such rules of inferences include:
  * **Modus Ponens**
  * **Modus Tollens**
  * **Hypothetical Syllogism**
  * **Disjunctive Syllogism**
  * **Addition**
  * **Simplification**
  * **Conjunction**
- We were taught how to use these rules of inference in the midst of arguments and premise.

# Week 4
- We learnt about the different "Methods of Proof". Such methods include:
  - Direct Proof
    1. Assume P is true.
    2. Show that Q is also true, using (1).
  - Proof by Contraposition
    1. Assume that -q is a hypothesis.
    2. Show that -p must be true using definition and previously defined theorems.
  - Vacuous Proof
    1. Show that p is false.
    2. P implying Q must be true if P is false.
  - Trivial Proof
    1. Show that q is true.
    2. P implying Q must also be true.
    3. Q implying (P implying Q).
  - Proof by Contradiction
    1. Assume not P.
    2. Show that (1) ends with Contradiction.
    3. Therefore, P is true.
  - Equivalence
    1. P implying Q is true.
    2. Therefore, Q implying P is also true.

# Week 5
- We were introduced to Mathematical Induction. 
  * Prove statement is true by inputting first value. If proven, use **Direct Proof**.
  * Assume P(k) is true.
  * Prove that P(k+1) is also true.

- This topic, I was confused because it disproves a fact. Although given more time to analyze, I was able to pick it up.
- I was also introduced to Recursive definition.
