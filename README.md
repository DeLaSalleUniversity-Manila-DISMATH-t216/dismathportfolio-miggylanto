## Leonardo Miguel Virtusio Lanto - My Weekly Portfolio - DISMATH SECTION EL
# Week 1
- This week, I was introduced to a new course called **DISMATH** or *Discrete Mathematics*.
- I introduced myself to class as a person who loves to chill. In order to get through **DISMATH**, I know I'd have to change that. I'd work as hard as ever.
- I was introduced to logical connectives, propositional statements, mathematical proofs, logical connectives and the like.
- I also learned about truth tables. I need to remember the process carefully because truth tables would really be essential for proving.
- I was also introdcued to propositional logic.

# Week 2
- I was introduced to logical equivalances. My thoughts about it was that it was like algebra, only that it uses words.
- I also learned about quantifiers. There are two types of quantifiers:
  * **Existential Quantifier** - "There Exists" meaning that there is at least one true value within the statement.
  * **Universal Quantifier** - "For all" which states that statement is true for all values.
- I've also been introduced to the topic of the terminologies of rules of inference.

# Week 3
- We were tasked to prove that *Superman* does not exist. Although I wasn't able to get it right away, I've found logical explanation through class hours.
- We learnt about the different rules of inferences. Such rules of inferences include:
  * **Modus Ponens**
  * **Modus Tollens**
  * **Hypothetical Syllogism**
  * **Disjunctive Syllogism**
  * **Addition**
  * **Simplification**
  * **Conjunction**
- We were taught how to use these rules of inference in the midst of arguments and premise.
- Some of the many lessons I'll have to take note of:
  * **Valid** - Final statement must follow the truth of preceding statement.
  * **Fallacy** - Invalid or Incorrect reasoning.
  * **Tautology** - Statement is always true.
  * **Argument** - Statement that ends with a conclusion.

# Week 4
- We learnt about the different "*Methods of Proof*". Such methods include:
  - Direct Proof
    1. Assume P is true.
    2. Show that Q is also true, using (1).
  - Proof by Contraposition
    1. Assume that -q is a hypothesis.
    2. Show that -p must be true using definition and previously defined theorems.
  - Vacuous Proof
    1. Show that p is false.
    2. P implying Q must be true if P is false.
  - Trivial Proof
    1. Show that q is true.
    2. P implying Q must also be true.
    3. Q implying (P implying Q).
  - Proof by Contradiction
    1. Assume not P.
    2. Show that (1) ends with Contradiction.
    3. Therefore, P is true.
  - Equivalence
    1. P implying Q is true.
    2. Therefore, Q implying P is also true.

# Week 5
- We were introduced to Mathematical Induction. 
  * Prove statement is true by inputting first value. If proven, use **Direct Proof**.
  * Assume P(k) is true.
  * Prove that P(k+1) is also true.

- This topic, I was confused because it disproves a fact. Although given more time to analyze, I was able to pick it up.
- I was also introduced to Recursive definition.

- This was also the week we were introduced to **Recursive Algorithms** and **Sets**.
- **Recursive Algorithms** - method to shorten that have repeating attributes in order to solve them faster and to understand them more efficiently.
- **Sets** - an unordered collection of elements.
  * *Empty Set* - a set containing no elements. Denoted as {} or null.
  * *Subset* - a set where all of its elements is contained by another set.
  * *Cardinality* - number of elements in a set.
  * *Set Builder Notation* - an efficient way of organizing sets in a mathematical way.

# Week 6

- This week, we were introduced to **Functions**. 
  * **Functions** - an assignment of an element B to an element A.
  * 3 TYPES OF FUNCTIONS:
  * 1.) *One-to-one*
  * 2.) *Onto*
  * 3.) *Bijection*
  
- We were also introuced to **Nested Quantifiers**.
- Preparation for QUIZ 1.

# Week 7
- No classes.

# Week 8
- This week, we were introduced to **Algorithms**.
  * **Pseudocode** - A way of representing an *Algorithm* using syntax language, particularly the C++ language. It is a program that is intended for human reading.
  * We were introduced to different types of simple Algorithms, as well as puzzling challenges and interesting lectures.

# Week 9
- We were introduced to *searching algorithms* as well as *order algorithms*. 
  * **Linear Search** - searches for a particular value in a certain input list that checks each value in the list until the element is found.
  * **Binary Search** - compares middle values of a certain list. This method is repeated until desired element is found.
  * **Bubble Sort** - compares starting elements and interchanges them if not in order. This method is repeated throughout the list.
  * **Insertion Sort** - just like the bubble sort, it compares the elements and interchanges them throughout the list, except that it focuses on the 2nd element first and compares it with the first element. 3rd with the 2nd, 4th with the 3rd, etc.
  * **Greedy Change** - a method to find the least amount of "*coins*" for change. Mainly uses denomination.


# Week 10
- We were introduced to **Functions**, **Growth of Functions**, **Time Complexity**.
  * **Functions** - a relationship or expression involving one or more variables.
  * **Time Complexity** - quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the input. Commonly expressed is with *Big-O Notation*.
  * **Big-O Notation** is the upperbound region of the function. Lower bound is represented by **Big-Omega**, while both regions are represented by the **Big-Theta**.
- We solved the worst-time complexities for algorithms like *Bubble-Sort*, *Insertion-Sort*, etc. 
- We were also introduced about the **Divisio** and the **Modulo** Operators
  * **Divisio** - an operator that gives the quotient of two given numbers.
  * **Modulo** - an operator that gives the remainder obtained when these two given numbers are divided.
- We also learned about the **Caesar's Cipher**.
  * **Caesar's Cipher** - it is a form of cryptography where the letter are shifted 3 times to the right. This method of cryptography was used back in the day during warfare.

# Week 11
- Holy Week! The Lord is my Father, my Savior!

# Week 12
- This week, we were introduced to the concepts of **Graphs**, **Euler Circuits**, **Euler Paths**, **Hamilton Circuits**, **Hamilton Paths**.
  * Graph Theory
  * **Graphs** - structures that are interconnected by *vertices*, which are then interconnected by *edges*.
  * **Vertices** - represented as islands during the lecture. These are the points which interconnect each edge, thus forming the figure.
  * **Edges** - represented as bridges between the islands. These are the lines which make up the figure.
  * **Degree** - number of edges connected to a vertex.
 
  * ##EULER CIRCUITS AND PATHS
  * **Euler Circuit** - a circuit that passes through each edge without repetition and then goes back to its starting point. A circuit where all of its vertices have even degrees.
  * **Euler Path** - a path that passes through each edge without repetition, whereas if compared to an *Euler Circuit*, it is not necessary for it to go back. A path that must contain at least two vertices with odd degree.
   
  
  * ##HAMILTON CIRCUITS AND PATHS
  * **Hamilton Circuit** - a circuit that passes through each and every vertex without repetition, and then goes back to its starting point. If there is a *Pendant*, it is not a *Hamilton circuit.*
  * **Hamilton Path** - a path that passes through each and every vertex without repetition. Unlike the *Hamilton Circuit*, it does not necessarily have to go back to its starting point.
  * **Pendant** - a vertex with only one degree.
  
  * **Terms to Remember**
  * **Matrix of a Graph** - we were introduced to *adjacency of matrices*, which displays a matrix that shows the connection of each and every vertex/edge of the graph. If connected, the legend shows 1. If not connected, the legend shows 0.
  * **Isomorphism** - a term used to show equal graphs, even when they are at two different states. Their *adjacency matrix* is technically equal.
  * **Planar and Non-Planar** - properties that show the possibility that edges do not cross each other. If they do, it is *Non-Planar*, while if they don't, the graph is *Planar*.
  
# Week 13
- This week, we were introduced to the final topics which would eventually conclude our **DISMATH** class. We were introduced to **Graph Coloring**, **Trees**, and the **Automata Theory**.
  * **Graph Coloring** - the assignment of colors to a vertex, where it must satisfy that its adjacent vertices must not have the same color. The number of colors is called the *Chromatic Number*. We were also introduced to the *Four Color Theorem*, which states that a planar graph must have a chromatic number less than or equal to four.
  * **Trees** - an undirected graph where its vertices are connected to each other like a hierarchy.
  * **Rooted Tree** - root vertex is specified. Edges are directed away from vertices. *Ordered Rooted Tree* is a tree where its children are ordered.
  * **M-ary Tree** - internal vertices is not higher than m amount of children.
  
- We were also introduced to a *Finite state machine*, as well as the concept of the vending machine program.\
- This concluded the entire coverage of lectures for this semester in **DISCRETE MATHEMATICS**. I'm going to miss it!
  
  * **READING ASSIGNMENTS**
  * Relations, Tree Traversal, Spanning Trees, Partial Ordering.
